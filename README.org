* About

[[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/dev/actions/workflows/test.yml][https://github.com/jakub-stastny/dev/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg]]

My development environment with my favourite tools and dotfiles.

I use it with [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/docker-project-manager][docker-project-manager]], which automates the usual project workflow: creating a project, spinning off a Docker image with that environment, creating a new pair of SSH keys and setting up port sharing. The resulting container runs OpenSSH server and can be SSH'd into directly, without the need to connect to the host machine first.

GitHub doesn't parse Orgmode files properly. Read the [[https://jakub-stastny.github.io/dev/][exported documentation]].
