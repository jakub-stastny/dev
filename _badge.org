  Dealing with SVG badges in Orgmode is tricky. Simply linking the image
  doesn't work when published, it creates a figure with huge edges.

  It works on GitHub though.

  The export block is what makes it work for Orgmode publish.
  But it doesn't work on GitHub. So we need both versions.

  GitHub simply ignores the export block and we hide the image
  on the published page using CSS, see the head of this file.
